# TO DO

- fix commenting prints at the end of pipeline
- set up simple multichannel file player instance in allolib

- do some quick atmos mixes for testing

- update readme

- transition to render without stem splitting, shouldnt be necessary

- switch to internal datastructures instead of many json's, but keep a single debugging json with info

* change everything to be stable build and git submodules instead of libraries?

-make notebook

# Less Immediate

\*change all instances of deleting a file(s) before writing to use one helper function from utils

- this is relevant in checkAudioChannels, createRenderInfo, extractMetaData, and others
  \*deal with static objects in renderInstructions

# to consider

- start testing examples from https://zenodo.org/records/15268471
- width parameter - relevant for dbap or reverb considerations

- bundle as one nice tool that can be accessed from command line

- build player in allolib that can cleanly handle these

- package the whole decoder into 1 alloapp - uses speaker layout json
